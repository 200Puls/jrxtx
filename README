jRxTx is a fork of RXTX which was originally maintained by Trent
Jarvi but was discontinued. The starting point of development was RXTX
v2.2-pre2 from 2009 + all patches by the Debian RXTX package
maintainers.

jRxTx is licensed under the LGPLv2.1 or later

jRxTx has the goal to maintain full backward compatibility to RXTX
while embracing future bug fixes by the community.

The following lists some of the improvements added to the original RXTX:

- Javadoc added

- Cleaned up the code and file structure to make it more maintainable.

- The jar file is now a bundle that can run in OSGi.

- The jar file is published on maven central.

- The Java build system has been moved to Gradle.

- Improve the input and output stream implementations that behave like
  the streams that the Java TCP socket API provides.
