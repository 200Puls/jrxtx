jRxTx is a fork of RXTX which was originally maintained by Trent
Jarvi but was discontinued. The starting point of development was RXTX
v2.2-pre2 from 2009 + all patches by the Debian RXTX package
maintainers.

jRxTx is licensed under the LGPLv2.1 or later

jRxTx has been initiated with the following goals in mind:

- Maintain backward compatibility to RXTX.

- Add javadoc

- Clean up the code and file structure to make it more maintainable.

- Make the jar file a bundle that can run in OSGi.

- Publish the jar file in maven central.

- Update the build system to use Gradle.

- Improve the input and output stream implementations (or add
  additional ones, to keep backward compatibility) that are returned
  by the SerialPort class. The improved streams shall behave like the
  streams that the Java TCP socket API provides.

- Embrace future bug fixes by the community.
