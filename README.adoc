= jRxTx: Java serial communication library.

The development team the goal to maintain full backward compatibility
to RXTX while adding a more convenient API and embracing future bug
fixes by the community.

The following lists some of the improvements added to the original RXTX:

* Javadoc added
* Cleaned up the code and file structure to make it more maintainable.
* The jar file is now a bundle that can run in OSGi.
* The jar file is published on maven central.
* The Java build system has been moved to Gradle.
* Improved input and output stream implementations so they behave like
  the streams that the Java TCP socket API provides.
