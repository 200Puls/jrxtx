== Intro



=== Distribution


== Using jRxTx

== Modifying and Compiling jRxTx

We use the Gradle build automation tool. The distribution contains a
fully functional gradle build file ("build.gradle"). Thus if you
changed code and want to rebuild a library you can do it easily with
Gradle. Also if you want to import our software into Eclipse you can
easily create Eclipse project files using Gradle. Just follow the
instructions on our FAQ site:

== Common Problems

ToDo add some from original INSTALL or README.Debian files
